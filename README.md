# [Restaurant Cashier System - Project]

This project is made to complete final project assignment for Reuse Oriented Programming course in Information System Major of Brawijaya University. We understand that this application may or may not have bugs and mis-implementations inside so we highly appreciate any feedback that we get. Other than that, we hope that this project able to help us further understand about reuse oriented programming and SOLID principle in software development.

The application is built in hopes of able to help restaurant to have their own personified restaurant cashier system. This application also developed as we see the need of reuseability in cashier system as many restaurant need a cashier system and that it would be cheaper and faster for them to develop the system using a ready-made application.

This application is built only using Java in accordance to SOLID Principle. In addition, this repository is equipped with System Design in Use Case and Class Diagrams for documentation. For further readability, we also provide comments inside our source code for you to easily learn the whole code.

This simple CLI application is built with several features for it's user such as:
